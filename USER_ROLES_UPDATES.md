# User Roles System - Updates Completed

## ✅ All Improvements Implemented

All critical security fixes and enhancements to the user roles system have been successfully implemented.

---

## 🔐 Security Fixes

### 1. **Changed Default Role to VIEWER** ✅
**File:** `context/AuthContext.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const [userRole, setUserRoleState] = useState<UserRole>(UserRole.ADMIN);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [userRole, setUserRoleState] = useState<UserRole>(UserRole.VIEWER);
```

**Impact:**
- New users now default to VIEWER role (read-only)
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive features
- Requires admin to manually upgrade user permissions

---

### 2. **Fixed Firestore Rules** ✅
**File:** `firestore.rules`

**Changes:**
- Fixed role name mismatches (now uses lowercase: `'admin'`, `'treasurer'`, `'editor'`, `'viewer'`)
- Added helper functions for each role
- Added `canEdit()` function for create/update permissions
- Viewers can now only read data, not create or edit

**New Rules:**
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return hasRole('admin');
}

function isTreasurer() {
  return hasRole('treasurer');
}

function isEditor() {
  return hasRole('editor');
}

function canEdit() {
  return isAdmin() || isTreasurer() || isEditor();
}

// Permissions
allow read: if isOwner(userId);
allow create: if isOwner(userId) && canEdit();
allow update: if isOwner(userId) && canEdit();
allow delete: if isOwner(userId) && isAdminOrTreasurer();
```
