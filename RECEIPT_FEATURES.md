/>

// With custom church info
<DonorReceipt 
  transaction={transaction}
  churchInfo={{
    name: "Your Church Name",
    address: "Your Address",
    phone: "Your Phone",
    email: "Your Email",
    website: "Your Website",
    taxId: "Your Tax ID",
    pastorName: "Pastor Name"
  }}
  logoUrl="/your-logo.png"
  showActions={true}
/>
```
