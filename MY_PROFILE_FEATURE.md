## 🔍 How Email Matching Works

### **Matching Logic:**
```typescript
// Case-insensitive email matching
const member = members.find(m => 
  m.email?.toLowerCase() === user.email?.toLowerCase()
);
```

### **Requirements:**
1. User must be logged in
2. User must have an email in Firebase Auth
3. A member record must exist with matching email
4. Email match is case-insensitive

### **Example:**
- User email: `john.doe@example.com`
- Member email: `John.Doe@Example.com`
- ✅ **Match!** (case-insensitive)

---

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### **For All Users:**
1. Log in to the system
2. Click "My Profile" in the navigation
3. View your profile information
4. Click "Print Profile" to print
5. Click "Back" to return to dashboard

### **For Admins:**
**To link a user to their profile:**
1. Create/edit member in Members section
2. Set the member's email to match the user's login email
3. User can now see their profile in "My Profile"
